# JavaScript Drum-kit
A drum kit made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Description
This is a simple and interactive drum kit web application where you can create your own beats using your keyboard. Each key corresponds to a specific drum sound, and visual feedback is provided when a key is pressed. The project was built to practice and learn DOM manipulation but also led to gaining additional experience with JavaScript, CSS, and handling audio files in web development.

# Features
- Keyboard Drum Kit: Play drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys on your keyboard.
- Visual Feedback: The key visuals respond dynamically, highlighting when pressed.
- Audio Integration: Includes preloaded drum sound effects for an authentic experience.
- Favicon Support: A small custom image appears on the browser tab for branding.

# Learning Outcomes
- Gained proficiency in DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
- Improved skills in integrating audio files for interactive experiences.
- Enhanced CSS styling knowledge for creating dynamic UI effects.
- Learned to add a favicon for better browser tab representation.

# Improvements
While the project works well, there is still a slight delay in audio playback that could be further optimized.

# How to Use
- Open the web page in your browser.
- Use your keyboard to press the keys corresponding to the drum sounds (e.g., 'S' for Hi-hat).
- Enjoy creating your beats! ðŸŽ¶
